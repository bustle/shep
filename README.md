## Why do you need this?

Amazon Web Services [API gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) are great tools for building and deploying ["serverless"](http://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-lambda-serverless-cloud/) applications. But using them to deploy more than a couple functions/endpoints involves an excessive amount of manual work such as zipping files, uploading via the web UI, configuring paths and function names, etc. Shep is built to automate as many of these tasks as possible, giving you the ability to deploy an entire API and suite of lambda functions with one CLI command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It will be helpful to have some existing experience with API gateway and Lambda. If you have never used either of these tools before, it is recommended to setup a function manually to see how things are done. Please refer to Amazon's own [getting started guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html)

### AWS credentials

Shep will require your amazon credentials and will load them using the same methods as the AWS CLI tool. Consult [Amazon's CLI documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html) for instructions.

### Installation

```bash
yarn install -g shep
yarn install --save-dev shep // the global shep will run the local shep
```

Add a few lines to your `package.json`. Your [account id](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account),

```json
{
  "name": "my-great-package",
  "shep": {
    "accountId": "XXXXX",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Custom Builds

By default shep builds all your functions using webpack. If your project requires a different build process, then edit your `package.json`. Before running your build command, shep populates the `PATTERN` environment variable which can be accessed as `process.env.PATTERN` in your build command. Be aware that using your own build process will break pattern matching for `shep build` unless your build command respects the `PATTERN` variable.

```json
{
  "shep": {
    "buildCommand": "custom-build --with-flag"
  }
}
```

## Lambda Execution Role

More details to come, but check out the AWS docs about setting up the proper IAM role for lambda: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example-create-iam-role.html

## Upgrading

Read the [migration docs](https://github.com/bustlelabs/shep/blob/master/migration.md) for information on upgrading major version changes

## Why the name 'shep'?

It was called 'shepherd' at first because it was helpful for dealing with *lamb*da but everyone kept shortening it to 'shep' so we changed the name
